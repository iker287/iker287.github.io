             hi eric is currrently unemployed and NEEDS a job to get money in order to lock inn so i made this website for him
          HE IS unemployed




            Eric does NOT have experience and he is currently broke and has been ever since he was born. he's a total loser
             Hope he takes it like a goob boy and uses my website tips :)
